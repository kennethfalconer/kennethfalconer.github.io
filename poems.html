<h3>
A Prime Rhyme</h3>

<p>If you want to show the primes go on for ever,
<br>There&#39;s a trick that Euclid taught us long ago.
<br>Suppose not: then multiply these primes together,
<br>And add one to get a number, call it rho.
<br>Just take a careful look at this big number,
<br>Rho has to have a factor which is prime,
<br>And it can&#39;t be one of those you &#39;ve got already,
<br>So there's your contradiction shown in rhyme.

<h3>
A Week in the Life of a Mathematician</h3>
<i>(with apologies to Michael Flanders and Donald Swann)</i>

<p>&#39;Twas on a Monday morning I had a bright idea,
<br>I was lying in the bath tub and the strategy seemed clear,
<br>For a problem posed by Erd&#246;s back in nineteen forty nine,
<br>On sequences dilated into subsets of the line

<p>&#39;Twas on a Tuesday morning I jotted down my thoughts,
<br>I covered backs of envelopes with surds and aleph noughts.
<br>After several cups of coffee I began to feel inspired,
<br>And a lengthy calculation gave the answer I desired.

<p>&#39;Twas on a Wednesday morning I wrote the details out.
<br>My lemmas and corollaries left little room for doubt.
<br>I filled up many pages just to get the logic right,
<br>And with epsilons and deltas I made it watertight.

<p>&#39;Twas on a Thursday morning I typed the paper up,
<br>With &#34;slash subset&#34; and &#34;slash mapsto&#34; to say nothing 
of &#34;slash cup&#34;.
<br>My LaTeXing was perfect, printed out it looked so good,
<br>Should I send it to the <i>Annals</i>? I rather thought I would!

<p>&#39;Twas on a Friday morning I read the paper through,
<br>I checked out every detail as good authors ought to do.
<br>At the bottom of page twenty in an integral I found,
<br>I&#39;d divided through by zero and the proof crashed to the ground.

<p>On Saturday and Sunday I was too depressed to care,
<br>So &#39;twas on a Monday morning that I had my next idea.

<h3>
 A Nightmare Seminar</h3>
<i>(with apologies to WS Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan)</i>


<p>When you go to a talk, speaker, blackboard and chalk, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	at the end of a hard day of teaching,
<br>It&#39;s no great surprise that you half close your eyes 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	and you can&#39;t concentrate on the preaching.
<br>You very soon find that your wandering mind 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	with ideas for strange theorems is teeming,
<br>But you&#39;re somewhat bemused and your thoughts get confused 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	and before very long you&#39;re just dreaming.
<br>For you meet a long line of numbers, all prime, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	that pass by with a nod now and then,
<br>With big gaps in the queue, the primes become few, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	a proportion one over log n.
<br>The gaps vary in size and you want to know why, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	so you write as an infinite sum
<br>Riemann&#39;s function called zeta, and what could be neater? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A product o&#39;er primes it becomes.
<br>You set out on a train &#39;cross the vast complex plane 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	as you search for the zeros of Riemann,
<br>There are plenty to find on the critical line 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	and you note them all down as you see them.
<br>Then the train hits a pole and you tumble and roll 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(near the pole it&#39;s as cold as an icicle),
<br>But you pick yourself up and you find you&#39;re in luck 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	for nearby is a rusty old bicycle.
<br>You pedal like mad, though the weather&#39;s turned bad, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	keeping lookout for rogue Riemann zeros,
<br>But before you get far you arrive at a bar 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	full of great mathematical heroes.
<br>Next to Hilbert and Gauss, you see Erd&#246;s and Straus 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	who&#39;re absorbed in some very hard thinking,
<br>Then there&#39;s Riemann and Rayleigh, and Cauchy and Cayley, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	and Euler with Fermat is drinking.
<br>You buy Riemann a beer, and he says: &#34;To be clear 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	why my zeros all lie in a row,
<br>You will need to consider with very great rigour 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	the way eigenvalues can grow.&#34;
<br>Although you implore, he won&#39;t tell any more 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	and so you depart on your travels,
<br>You keep scratching your head at what Riemann said 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	but the problem you still can&#39;t unravel.
<br>By a river that&#39;s deep you encounter a heap 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	of some very large matrices random,
<br>And their eigenvalues and the Riemann zeros 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	wander off to infinity in tandem.
<br>You then get the point that if one&#39;s self-adjoint 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	eigenvalues all lie on a line,
<br>And the same should be so for the Riemann zeros -  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	an idea that is somewhat sublime.
<br>You allow a faint smile as you search through the pile 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	for such matrices, hoping you&#39;ll see them,
<br>You spot one midst the trash - and you see in a flash 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	how to prove the Hypothesis Riemann.
<br>You start work right away and by night and by day 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	you fill hundreds of pages with writing,
<br>The lemmas are tricky, the details are sticky, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	and getting it right&#39;s quite exciting.
<br>You break out in a sweat for you mustn&#39;t forget 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	any parts of the proof you&#39;re recording,
<br>But at last comes the end and you put down your pen ... 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	and wake up to your colleagues&#39; applauding ...

<p>You&#39;re a regular wreck with a crick in your neck,
<br>Your hair&#39;s in a mess and your head&#39;s on the desk,
<br>Your mouth&#39;s open wide and your tie&#39;s to one side, 
<br>The board&#39;s covered with chalk and you&#39;ve missed all the talk,
<br>You&#39;ve forgotten your proof which must be a spoof,
<br>Your face has turned red, you&#39;ve an ache in your head,
<br>With a throb that&#39;s intense and a general sense 
<br>That you&#39;ll take a long time to recover.

<p>But the seminar&#39;s past, you can go home at last,
<br>And the day has been long, ditto ditto my song,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And thank goodness they&#39;re both of them over!

<h3>
A Poem of Academic Prejudice</h3>

<p>Our Pure Mathematicians are wise and profound:
<br>They prove deep new theorems with arguments sound.
<br>They solve old conjectures and work problems out,
<br>And their elegant methods leave nothing in doubt.

<p>But Applied Mathematicians are dubious types,
<br>They study strange flows yet can't sort out our pipes.
<br>They get hefty grants just to show the Sun's hot,
<br>When up here in Scotland it's patently not.

<p>The Statistics Division, well what do they do?
<br>They count furry mammals and shoals of fish, too.
<br>From vast piles of data find medians and mids,
<br>And conclude everybody has two point three kids.

<p>In Computing, where life is controlled by machines,
<br>And eyesight is ruined by staring at screens,
<br>They write complex programs that may never stop,
<br>And argue if P equals NP or not.

<p>Then over in Physics they do tricks with light,
<br>Show near absolute zero things don't work quite right.
<br>In accelerators costing us millions each week,
<br>With quarks and Higgs bosons they play hide and seek.

<p>And going into town, one can only despair
<br>At Divinity, Russian and other schools there.
<br>For History's happened and Latin is dead,
<br>And Philosophers do all their thinking in bed.
<br>

<p>The English department could scarcely be worse,
<br>They don't even try to put rhymes in their verse.
<br>Then Geographers blame us for greenhouse effects,
<br>Whilst Psychologists put all we do down to sex.

<p>As for other departments, and I've missed out a few,
<br>To list their shortcomings I'll leave up to you.
<br>But Pure Mathematicians are noble and good,
<br>And wonderful people, though misunderstood!

<h3>First Year Mathematics Exam</h3>
<p>
You should answer all the questions on this paper,
<br>You'll find two hours will be sufficient time. 
<br>You must give full derivations of your answers, 
<br>Your solutions should, of course, all be in rhyme.
<p>
1.
<br>Question one will test your skill with complex numbers:
<br>Take the pair 4 + 3i and i + 1.
<br>First add, then multiply, these two together,
<br>Divide the second by the first once this is done.
<br>Next, write down the argument and modulus
<br>Of i + 1; thus find its thirteenth power.
<br>And after that we'd like to know its cube roots,
<br>This should not take more than quarter of an hour!
<p>
2. 
<br>Here's a matrix <i>A</i> that has to be inverted:
<br>The top row has the entries 1, 2, 3,
<br>In the middle are the numbers 2, 5, 20,
<br>At the bottom 3, 6, 10 is what you see.
<br>To round this off, some linear equations:
<br>Can you solve the system <i>Ax</i> equals <i>c</i>,
<br>Where <i>c</i>'s the column vector (2, 6, 7)?
<br>Then what d'you think the vector <i>x</i> must be?
<p>
3.
<br>Next, please define the hyperbolic functions.
<br>Find the difference of the squares of cosh and shine.
<br>Use this fact to do a simple integration
<br>Of 1 over root 4 <i>x</i> squared minus 9.
<br>After this, you should evaluate the limit
<br>Of <i>x</i> squared over cosh <i>x</i> minus 1,
<br>As the variable <i>x</i> approaches zero;
<br>L'Hopital might help you get this question done.
<p>
4.
<br>Now here's a homogeneous equation:
<br><i>y</i> double dot plus <i>y</i> dot equals nought.
<br>You must calculate the general solution,
<br>Which shouldn't take up too much time or thought.
<br>Now change this differential equation,
<br>By putting on the right hand side sin <i>t</i>.
<br>Solve this, with the initial conditions
<br>Of <i>y</i> dot equals 5, <i>y</i> equals 3.
<p>
5.
<br>S'pose <b>a</b>'s the vector <b>i</b> + <b>j</b> +2 <b>k</b>,
<br>And <b>b</b>'s 2 <b>i</b> + <b>j</b> + 7 <b>k</b>.   
<br>Then what d'you think the product <b>a</b> dot <b>b</b> is?
<br>Also the vector product, <b>b</b> cross <b>a</b>?
<br>And next perhaps you'd work out the equation
<br>Of the plane containing vectors <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.
<br>And finally, we'd like to know its distance
<br>From the point that has coordinates (1, 2, 3).
<p>
6.
<br>Show the cubes of all the first <i>n</i> natural numbers
<br>Sum to quarter of <i>n (n + 1)</i> all squared.
<br>We suggest you use mathematical induction -
<br>A technique on which you should be well-prepared.
<br>Now what about the first <i>n</i> even numbers,
<br>And after that the first <i>n</i> odd ones too?
<br>What do the cubes of odds and evens sum to?
<br>It shouldn't be too hard to think this through!
<p>
7.
<br>Our final question deals with infinite series: 
<br>Give reasons why they converge, if they do.
<br>First, how about the series where the <i>n</i>-th term 
<br>Is 3 <i>n</i> over <i>n</i> cubed minus 2?
<br>Next think about the case of sine of <i>n</i> squared
<br>Divided by <i>n</i> squared - what happens then?
<br>And finally, maybe a little harder,
<br>The summation of 1 over <i>n</i> log <i>n</i>?

<h3>A Toast to Pi</h3>
<p>The distance round a circle,
<br>Whose diameter is d,
<br>Is quickly found by multiplying
<br>By not much more than three.

<p>Well-known by the Egyptians,
<br>Four thousand years ago;
<br>Indeed, the Rhind Papyrus
<br>Gives three point one six oh.

<p>Along came Archimedes,
<br>Who, not to be outdone,
<br>With polygons and rigour,
<br>Got three point one four one.

<p>Then in the sixteen sixties,
<br>James Gregory came to town,
<br>And for the inverse tan of x,
<br>A series he wrote down.

<p>It rapidly converges,
<br>If x is not too big.
<br>Taking x as root one third
<br>We get far more sig figs.

<p>This number didn’t have a name
<br>Till seventeen oh six,
<br>When Jones, a Welshman, came along,
<br>This oversight to fix.

<p>He soon rejected nu and mu
<br>And omicron and xi,
<br>Then musing on his apple tart,
<br>Cried “Ah - Let's call it pie!”.

<p>But now we use computers,
<br>To save us time and space.
<br>Last year one took four months to get
<br>The sixty-trillionth place.

<p>We rightly toast this number,
<br>So lift your glasses high,
<br>As on this day we celebrate,
<br>The ratio known as pi.
