Kenneth Falconer is a mathematician who specialises in Fractal Geometry and 
related topics. 
He is Regius Professor of Mathematics at the 
<a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk">University of St Andrews</a>
and a member of the <a 
href="http://www-maths.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/index.html">Analysis
Research Group</a> of the 
<a href="http://www-maths.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/index.shtml">School
of Mathematics and Statistics</a>. He was an undergraduate (graduating as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangler_(University_of_Cambridge)">Wrangler</a>), 
research student and 
Research
Fellow at <a href="http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/">Corpus Christi College, 
Cambridge</a>. 
He became a Lecturer and
then a Reader at the <a href="http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</a>
 before being appointed Professor at St Andrews
in 1993. He was appointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regius_Professor_of_Mathematics">
Regius Professor of Mathematics</a> in 2017. 
He was elected a Fellow of the <a 
href="https://www.rse.org.uk">Royal
Society of Edinburgh</a> in 1998 and was awarded the <a  
href="https://www.lms.ac.uk/sites/lms.ac.uk/files/files/Falconer_Shephard_citation.pdf">
Shephard Prize</a> of the London 
Mathematical Society in 2020.
<p>Kenneth's main research interests are in fractal and multifractal 
geometry, geometric
measure theory and related areas. His wide-ranging research has involved the description,
occurrence, geometrical properties and dimensional analysis of fractal
sets and measures. For example, his work on projections of fractals led
to the concept of the <a href="http://www.digitalsundial.com/">digital
sundial</a> (a set with essentially any desired projections in all 
directions).
He has derived formulae for the dimensions of specific types of fractals
and multifractals, notably introducing the `affinity dimension' and its 
relatives for 
analysis of self-affine sets and measures and non-conformal repellers
in dynamical systems. He introduced the <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconer%27s_conjecture">distance problem</a>. 
He has worked on dimensional and topological 
properties
of random fractals and multifractals, including fractal percolation 
problems, partial differential equations on fractal
domains, and  fractal processes displaying forms of statistical 
self-similarity. His other research interests also have a geometric 
flavour, including the geometry of convex sets, combinatorial geometry and the 
mathematics of X-ray tomography. He has published over 130 papers in
mathematics journals. 
<p>He has written five books <a 
href="http://www.wiley.com/go/fractal">Fractal
Geometry - Mathematical Foundations and Applications </a> (with
<a 
href="http://eu.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/fractal/falconer7174.html">Solutions 
Manual 2nd Ed.</a>
<a 
href="http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=resource&bcsId=8728&itemId=111994239X&resourceId=34235">Solutions 
Manual 3rd Ed.</a>),
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Techniques+in+Fractal+Geometry-p-9780471957249">Techniques
in Fractal Geometry</a> and <a 
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/geometry-of-fractal-sets/7ECAB3C918C66E62AB673246B2CDE6FA">The
Geometry of Fractal Sets</a> treat many mathematical aspects of fractal
geometry. His recent book, <a 
href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199675982.do#.Ukrn1OBVr3U">
Fractals - A Very Short Introduction</a>, presents the ideas of fratals at a 
very basic level.
The book, <a 
href="http://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780387975061#otherversion=9781461269625">
Unsolved Problems in Geometry</a>, 
written
with Hallard Croft and Richard Guy, surveys problems that are 
intuitively easy to understand but were unsolved at the time of 
writing, though many of the problems  have since been solved. 
In 2000 he gave the London Mathematical Society annual Popular
Lecture <i>Fractals - the New Geometry</i>, which is available on a 
<a 
href="http://www.lms.ac.uk/content/popular-lectures-dvds">DVD</a>.

<p>Kenneth has spoken at many major international conferences on
fractal geometry and analysis. He was Principal Organiser of the four month
Programme on Fractal Mathematics and Applications at the <a 
href="https://www.newton.ac.uk">Isaac
Newton Institute</a> in Cambridge from January to April 1999, and 
Co-organiser of a Programme on Fractals and Dynamics at the <a 
href="http://www.mittag-leffler.se">Mittag-Leffler 
Institute</a>  near Stockholm from September to December 2017. He was 
Chair of the British Mathematical Colloquium 2018 
held in St Andrews.  
He has been a Visiting Professor at a number of universities 
including Oregon State University and the Australian National University, 
Canberra, as well as at the Isaac Newton Institute on several occasions.
<p>
<p>He was a member of the Council of the <a 
href="http://www.lms.ac.uk/">London Mathematical Society</a> for 9 years 
and was their Publications 
Secretary from 2006-09. He has also has served on the General Committee of the
<a href="http://www.ems.ac.uk">Edinburgh
Mathematical Society</a>. He is on the Editorial Boards of   
<a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/fractals">Fractals</a>,
<a href="http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/journal.php?jrn=jfg">Journal of Fractal Geometry</a>,
 and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-proceedings-of-the-cambridge-philosophical-society/information">
 Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society</a>.


<p>Kenneth's main leisure activity is long distance walking and 
hillwalking.
He has twice climbed all 
the <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Munros">Munros</a>

(Scottish hills over 3000ft), as well as all the
<a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Corbett_mountains_in_Scotland">Corbetts</a>
(2500-2999ft). He is an active member of the <a 
href="http://www.ldwa.org.uk">Long
Distance Walkers Association</a>, and was Chairman from 2000-03 and Editor of their magazine
<i>Strider</i>
from 1987-92, 2007-12 and 2022-23;
in 2021 he became Vice-President. He has 
completed 36 of
the LDWA's annual hundred mile continuous cross-country walks in times 
around
from 26 to 34 hours. He is a 
<a href="https://centurions1911.org.uk">Centurion</a>
and a member of the <a 
href="https://www.rhsoc.uk/the-marilyns-hall-of-fame-2021/">Marilyn Hall of 
Fame</a>.
